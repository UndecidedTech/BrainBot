# BrainBot
Discord bot testing



Of course to get setup with your own BrainBot I would strongly suggest you use: 

* https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/#listening-for-messages
* https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

These sources will help you get up and running with generating an api_token for your bot, and how to add it to your servers

To run the bot:

first you need to create a .env file in BrainBot/

.env only needs to contain one line
```bash
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
Then run:

```javascript
npm install
node src/index.js
```
